# bibtools: a command-line bibliography manager

This is `bib`, a command-line bibliography manager. It retrieves fulltext
articles, manages their storage on disk, and maintains a database of their
bibliographic information.


## Installation

For now you should run:

```sh
pip install .
```

This package is on the [Python package index][1], but that version is mega-old.
