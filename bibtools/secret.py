"""Handling of the user's login secret.

I've made the decision to store this on disk without requiring user input to
access the secret -- i.e., this is what Firefox does for user website
passwords when a Master Password hasn't been enabled. I feel sketchy about
this, but if Mozilla is OK with it, then so am I.

I follow what I believe to be Firefox's storage strategy, which is to use
symmetric encryption to store the secret on disk, with the relevant encryption
keys also stored on disk. Obviously this only provides security against a
completely unmotivated attacker, but it prevents accidental disclosure, and
again, this approach seems to be good enough for Mozilla.

There are crypto modules for Python, but the examples I saw were lengthy and
the modules aren't preinstalled on my computer (therefore most people probably
don't have them), so I've farmed out the work to the openssl CLI.

Because we're in Python, I'm sure that we're doing all sorts of unfortunate
things like keeping the decrypted secret in memory for too long, etc.
